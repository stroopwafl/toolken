## Toolken

This repo is an unofficial implementation of "ToolkenGPT: Augmenting Frozen Language Models with Massive Tools via Tool Embeddings" (Hao et al., 2023). It needs a lot of testing, but it is significantly simpler and more scalable than Toolformer (with the experience of having implemented Toolformer!). If you are considering teaching LLMs to use tools, I suggest testing this method for this reason.

All data, prompts and templates are taken from the [original ToolkenGPT repo](https://github.com/Ber666/ToolkenGPT).
