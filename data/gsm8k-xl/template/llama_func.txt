Question: The math questions in a contest are divided into three rounds: easy, average, and hard. There are corresponding points given for each round. That is 2, 3, and 5 points for every correct answer in the easy, average, and hard rounds, respectively. Suppose Kim got 6 correct answers in the easy; 2 correct answers in the average; and 4 correct answers in the difficult round, what are her total points in the contest?
Answer: Kim got 6 points/round x 2 round = <multiply>(6, 2)=12 points in the easy round. She got 2 points/round x 3 rounds = <multiply>(2, 3)=6 points in the average round. She got 4 points/round x 5 rounds = <multiply>(4, 5)=20 points in the difficult round. So her total points is 12 points + 6 points + 20 points = <add>(12, 6, 20)=38 points. #### 38

Question: A clothing store sells 20 shirts and 10 pairs of jeans. A shirt costs $10 each and a pair of jeans costs twice as much. How much will the clothing store earn if all shirts and jeans are sold?
Answer: Twenty shirts amount to $10 x 20 = $<multiply>(10, 20)=200. The cost of each pair of jeans is $10 x 2 = $<multiply>(10, 2)=20. So 10 pairs of jeans amount to $20 x 10 = $<multiply>(20, 10)=200. Therefore, the store will earn $200 + $200 = $<add>(200, 200)=400 if all shirts and jeans are sold. #### 400

Question: Arnold's collagen powder has 18 grams of protein for every 2 scoops.  His protein powder has 21 grams of protein per scoop.  And his steak has 56 grams of protein.   If he has 1 scoop of collagen powder, 1 scoop of protein powder and his steak, how many grams of protein will he consume?
Answer: 2 scoops of collagen powder have 18 grams of protein and he only has 1 scoop so he consumes 18/2 = <divide>(18, 2)=9 grams of protein He has 9 grams collagen powder, 21 grams of protein powder and 56 grams in his steak for a total of 9+21+56 = <add>(9, 21, 56)=86 grams of protein #### 86
