## Toolformer

This repo is an unofficial implementation of "Toolformer: Language Models Can Teach Themselves to Use Tools" (Schick et al., 2023), built with nbdev. You'll find all the code inside the `nbs` folder, which can be run from inside the notebooks or via scripts in the `scripts` folder. The clean code modules can be found inside the `toolformer` folder. It is plug-and-play as long as you have the LLaMA (v1) model weights â€” I have tested with both the 7B and 13B models (though it should also extend to the larger models if you have the GPU power).
